    "world-of-boleham": "Boleham's story began before the beginning of time, out of nowhere the goddess Luximis appeared and with her appearance, time began to flow in the remote universe. Tired of the immensity of the void, Luximis decided to transform this universe into a place where life could emerge, creating Sollum at the center of everything, surrounded by Boleham and its 5 sister planets, Ascaron, Senia, Lasid, Rista and Mhurfa. Luximis added everything that pleased and enchanted him to his universe, so he decided to present Boleham with Luna and Selene, two moons to light up the dark nights. Then Luximis planted the first seed of life in the world. This was the 'Hello, world' of Boleham's World, and from then on life began to evolve and transform",
    "the-elemental-dragons": "After the creation of the moons, Luximis created powerful and conscious creatures to shape the world, after all, it was his desire for it to be irregular and unexpected. This is how the Elemental Dragons emerged and gave the world the shape it has today. They are <nature>Aard</nature>, the Elemental Dragon of <nature>nature</nature>; <fire>Vatra</fire>, the Elemental Dragon of <fire>fire</fire>; <air>Zrak</air>, the Elemental Dragon of <air>air</air>; <water>Akvo</water>, the Elemental Dragon of <water>water</water>; <earth>Uraqi</earth>, the Elemental Dragon of <earth>earth</earth>; <ice>Akull</ice>, the Elemental Dragon of <ice>ice</ice>; <lightning>Raza</lightning>, the Elemental Dragon of <lightning>lightning</lightning>; <darkness>Tenebris</darkness>, the Elemental Dragon of <darkness>darkness</darkness> and <light>Liicht</light>, the Elemental Dragon of <light>light</light>. With the world shaped, Luximilis allowed all dragons to live free to do as they please.",
    "born-of-all-creatures": "After spending many centuries shaping the world, the Elemental Dragons felt lonely in the planet's vast mountains, so they came together to decide what they should do to resolve this. The Elemental Dragons of <fire>fire</fire>, <water>water</water>, <darkness>darkness</darkness> and <nature>nature</nature> only wanted to create sentient animals and plants, while the <lightning>lightning</lightning>, <ice>ice</ice>, <light>light</light> and <earth>earth</earth> just wanted to create conscious and rational animals. After much discussion, the <air>air</air> Elemental Dragon was in favor of doing both, and both sides gave in. Thus life began to flourish in Boleham's world in its various forms, through humans, semi-humans, fauna and flora.",
    "the-draconic-church": "With the adoration of their creators, humans and demi-humans founded the Draconic Churches, dedicated to worshiping all dragons, who offered their blessings to mortals. They also created churches dedicated to specific dragons around the world, such as the Holy Church of Liicht and the Great Cathedral of Razayarik, which despite giving you a specific dragon to worship, continue to offer blessings to everyone. Nowadays it is difficult to see any of the dragons around the world, their whereabouts are unknown.",
    "the-fall-of-gods": "Humans and other races were already walking around Boleham, when gods from another universe decided that they would live here, they had been abandoned by their faithful who had started to worship other gods. Of course Luximis stopped them, after all that would put the existence of their world at risk. Luximis argued about the descent of the gods to Boleham for a century until they finally reached an agreement. The gods who wanted to descend to their world would have to abstain from their divine privileges, however they would continue to have immortality and an attribute of their own that they could share with humans who joined their families. Present here on earth, the gods heard about the discovery of Babel, an immense labyrinth in the plains, with several floors full of challenges and enemies. The gods all went to live in this region to help humans explore the Dungeon.",
    "menhera-summon": "Menhera had an ordinary and peaceful life as a young student in Rio Grande do Sul, like a good gaúcha, she always lived with her chimarrão. On a day like any other, she was drinking her chima before going to school when her house was taken over by a golden glow. Suddenly she was in space, in front of a creature she didn't know. The creature began to apologize to her, promising that he would give Menhera one more chance. Before she missed the opportunity, Menhera asked the entity what was happening and who she was, so the entity introduced herself: 'I am Luximis, I accidentally ended up bringing you from your world to mine and I have no way of taking you back. That's why I'm going to give you the chance to live a life as you wish.' Before anything could be said about it, Luximis added: 'I can't waste too much time, otherwise you'll get lost. I will give you the gift of living until you get tired of being alive, use it wisely.' And so in the blink of an eye, Menhera found herself in another world, alone, with just a kit to produce chimarrão that included seeds to produce her own herb with an unlimited lifespan. That was the beginning of Menhera's journey through Boleham.",
    "the-find-of-babel-dungeon": "Babel was underground in the middle of a large plain and was discovered by a merchant who was crossing the area. Its entrance revealed its shape on the walls, a tower that descended infinite floors. Its appearance intrigued everyone, as did its operation. Many people entered the Dungeon to discover what existed at its end, but ended up dying because they were unable to deal with the dangers there. Therefore, Menhera decided to found the Guild and manage the entrance to the dungeon. As a result, a city was formed around the dungeon, which was named Sfide.",
    "the-guild": "The history of the Guild in the world of Boleham is relatively recent, it was founded by Grand Master Menhera, some time after the discovery of Babel. Since then, the Guild has been trying to explore all the dungeons in the world and protect people from the dangers of the monsters that live there. To this day, the Guild is managed by Menhera, who continues to look the same as when they appeared in Boleham. Even so, other smaller guilds were created in all cities to assist in the management of territories.",
    "the-start-of-chaos": "On a night of double lunar eclipse - when a lunar eclipse occurs at the same time that Luna aligns herself in front of Selene, the Babel dungeon collapsed, the city began to shake and then the Dungeon simply disappeared leaving an empty hole in its former Prohibited. Shortly after this event, monsters began to appear all over the world, outside the dungeons. In this episode, the gods who descended into the world disappeared without leaving any trace or warning, their family members who had received their blessings continued to receive their power until the end of their lives, although they were not that long. It was as if the world had purged the gods, and as if Babel was the mother of the monsters behind it. No one knows exactly what happened at that time, not even Grand Master Menhera, who was present, knows exactly what happened."
